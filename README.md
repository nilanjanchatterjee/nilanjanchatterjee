- 👋 Hi, I’m @nilanjanchatterjee, a Postdoctoral Associate at CFANS, University of Minnesota.
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling ecological data using different statstical tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently working in Moveapps (https://www.moveapps.org/) where I develop apps for analysis of animal tracking data mostly using the Movebank (https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main) environment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on methodological development of ecological data analysis. I have used motion-triggered remote camera data in my PhD to estimate population density of different species and currently using animal tracking data to learn more about different behavioural states. 
- 📫 Want to learn more about my work and want to collaborate, drop me an email at nchatteratumndotedu
